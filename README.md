## Changes ##
This version is to run under Windows 10 (or Wine), and provide strict
mode with standard in and standard out (to use with qjs).

gwsocket [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/allinurl/gwsocket.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/allinurl/gwsocket) [![gwsocket](http://gwsocket.io/badge?v0.1)](http://gwsocket.io)
========

## What is it? ##
**gwsocket** is a simple, standalone, language-agnostic, RFC6455 compliant
WebSocket Server, written in C. It sits between your application and the
client's browser, giving fast bidirectional communication between these two
with ease and flexibility. More info at:
[http://gwsocket.io](http://gwsocket.io/?src=gh).

## How it Works? ##
Very simple, just redirect the output from your application **(stdout)** to
`stdin` or to file (named pipe) and let **gwsocket** transfer the data to the
browser — That's it.

For example, tailing your server's logs into the browser couldn't be easier

    # tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log > /tmp/wspipein.fifo

OR

    # tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log | gwsocket

You can also get the client's data into **(stdin)** your application. In fact,
you can even send your favorite ncurses program's output to the browser. See
screencast above.

## Features ##
* Message Fragmentation per section [5.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#page-33)
* UTF-8 Handling
* Framing (Text & Binary messages)
* Multiplexed non-blocking network I/O
* Ability to pipe data in/out in two different modes (**stdin/stdout & strict mode**)
* Origin-based restriction
* It passes the [Autobahn Testsuite](http://gwsocket.io/autobahn/) :)
* and of course, [Valgrind](http://valgrind.org/) tested
* missing something?, please feel free to post it on Github.

## Why gwsocket? ##
I needed a **fast**, **simple**, **no-dependencies**, **no libraries**,
**RFC6455 compliant** WebSocket Server written in C that I could use for
version 1.0 of [**GoAccess**](https://goaccess.io/) by simply piping data in
and out — WebSockets made easy!

## More Examples? ##
gwsocket is language agnostic, look at the [Man Page](http://gwsocket.io/man?src=gh)
for more details and examples on how to receive data from the browser and how
to send it to the browser.

## Installation ##
Installing gwsocket is pretty easy. Just download, extract and compile it with:

```
$ wget http://tar.gwsocket.io/gwsocket-0.3.tar.gz
$ tar -xzvf gwsocket-0.3.tar.gz
$ cd gwsocket-0.3/
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install
```
No dependencies needed. How nice isn't it :), well almost, you need `gcc`, `make`, etc.

## Build from GitHub ##
```
$ git clone https://github.com/allinurl/gwsocket.git
$ cd gwsocket
$ autoreconf -fiv
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install
```

## Data Modes ##
In order to establish a channel between your application and the client's
browser, gwsocket provides two methods that allow the user to send data in and
out. The first one is through the use of the standard input (stdin), and the
standard output (stdout). The second method is through a fixed-size header
followed by the payload. See options below for more details.

### STDIN/STDOUT ###
The standard input/output is the simplest way of sending/receiving data to/from
a client. However, it's limited to broadcasting messages to all clients. To
send messages to or receive from a specific client, use the strict mode in the
next section. See language specific examples [here](http://gwsocket.io/).

### Strict Mode ###
gwsocket implements its own tiny protocol for sending/receiving data. In
contrast to the **stdin/stdout** mode, the strict mode allows you to
send/receive data to/from specific connected clients as well as to keep track
of who opened/closed a WebSocket connection. It also gives you the ability to
pack and send as much data as you would like on a single message. See language
specific examples [here](http://gwsocket.io/).

## Command Line / Config Options ##
